# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Examine the factors that influence tuberculosis by focusing on Africa, the continent with the highest number of tuberculosis-related deaths.

## Process
1) I accessed the "TD_Burden_Country.csv" dataset.
2) Upon reviewing the dataset, I discerned various data types.
3) I explored the causes of tuberculosis by examining the relationships among major data points using "tuberculosis" as a keyword.
4) I created a dashboard that visualizes data pertaining to tuberculosis factors in Africa.
5) I assessed the accuracy of different data derivation methods and determined which was the most effective.

## Results (IV. Tuberculosis Burden by Country)
I observed that in regions with lower TB mortality rates (excluding HIV cases), the mortality rate of TB among HIV-positive individuals also tends to be low. As TB mortality (excluding HIV) rises, the prevalence of TB often follows suit. Interestingly, there wasn't a distinct correlation between the mortalities of HIV and TB, with rates varying across different countries. I also noted that countries with a high number of TB deaths typically have lower CDR values, implying a relationship between CDR and TB deaths. This trend suggests that countries with less effective TB control measures might experience a surge in TB cases.

Further analysis revealed certain patterns, including the alarming observation that contracting TB, whether associated with breast cancer or an accident, often corresponds to a high mortality rate. When examining the distributions of TB incidence rates, high-income regions generally display lower incidences of TB, though exceptions are present. The "Mortality Neighbor" method offers a varied distribution, indicating disparities in incidence rates across regions.

Additionally, the methods employed to estimate TB prevalence produced different outcomes. For instance, the "Predicted" method yielded the most consistent results with minimal variation in estimates. In terms of TB mortality rates, the "VR imputed" method demonstrated the least variability, with data points primarily clustering at the lower end of the scale.

## Challenges 
1) Analyzing the vast amount of data presented challenges in pinpointing the exact metrics necessary for the analysis.
2) While Tableau offers a wide range of visualization types, there are limits to how much I can customize them without resorting to more complex workarounds.
3) Fine-tuning the data visualizations in Tableau posed certain difficulties, especially in achieving precise representations.

## Future Goals
1) Expand the analysis to other continents to get a more holistic view of global TB patterns and compare them with the findings from Africa.
2) Other biological or environmental data may be searched to find significant factors related to tuberculosis.
